DriverPower is a tool used to discover potential coding and non-coding cancer driver elements from tumour whole-genome or whole-exome somatic mutations.

## How to use DriverPower
If you only have somatic mutations (in hg19) at hand and
would like to find drivers in well-annotated regions, please use our [example data](https://figshare.com/projects/DriverPower_Dataset/36065)
and follow the [tutorial](https://driverpower.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html).
